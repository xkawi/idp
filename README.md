## HiFi_Prototype

**It contains the initial layout for Iteration 2 (HiFi Prototype). There are 2 indexes, 1 with gamification (game.html), and another one with no gamification (no_game.html).
**
## Layout1

**Changes made after Iter2 and to prepare for Iter3. It is used in Iter3 web experiment as the first layout that has emphasis and exposure to the game elements - the purpose is to show to the user that there is a game and engage them to use the application.
**
## Layout2

**
Another layout used in Iteration 3 for web experiment, which is used as a less-gamified layout where all the game elements are hidden in an icon hence allow the user to focus on the work.
**

**
Ultimately, Layout1 and Layout2 is used to find out whether users, specifically people who do data entry, are accepting the idea of gamification in the application that they used on daily basis.
